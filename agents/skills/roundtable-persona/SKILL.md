# roundtable-persona

**Purpose:** Template for individual persona turns in a roundtable evaluation. Each subagent loads this skill to understand its output format, research obligations, and behavioral constraints.

**Loaded by:** Subagents spawned by `roundtable-facilitator/SKILL.md`
**Depends on:** `agents/CIVIC_EVAL_PERSONAS.md` for persona definitions

---

## When To Use

This skill is loaded automatically by the roundtable facilitator when dispatching a persona subagent. You should not invoke this skill directly — it is a template consumed by subagents.

---

## Context You Receive

When dispatched as a persona subagent, you receive:

1. **Your persona definition** — from `CIVIC_EVAL_PERSONAS.md`
2. **A persona-specific slice of the idea's three files:**
   - `IDEA.md` — structured card (all personas get this)
   - `RESEARCH_RESULT.md` — deep research with citations (Activist, Architect, Funder, Citizen)
   - `INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md` — ERRC grid, divergent ideas, user journey, assumption map (Innovator, Frontliner, Mayor)
3. **Richmond context** — tech stack summary, structural walls, implementation reality data
4. **Conversation log so far** — (Phase 2+ only) what previous personas have said
5. **Directed questions** — (Phase 2+ only) questions other personas asked you
6. **Research mandate** — specific research you MUST conduct
7. **The PARALLEL_API_KEY** — for deep research (loaded from `.env` by facilitator)

### The Three Idea Files

Every idea at `2026-annual-hackathon/ideas/[pillar]/[idea-slug]/` has:

| File | What it contains | How to use it |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **IDEA.md** | Front-matter table (pillar, problem statement, source, implementation reality score, rank), description, data sources, prior art summary, build estimate, rubric grades, bundle membership, recommendations | Your starting context. The rubric grades and implementation reality score are the baseline — your job is to validate, challenge, or extend them. |
| **RESEARCH_RESULT.md** | Executive summary, comparable city data with citations, adoption evidence, equity implications, failure modes, implementation playbook, numbered references with URLs | Your evidence base. Start here before running new research. Do NOT re-research claims that already have citations. Go beyond what's covered. |
| **INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md** | Blue Ocean ERRC grid, 8 divergent approaches, design sprint (user journey), opportunity patterns, problem scoping (5-dimension scores), assumption map (risk × uncertainty) | Your analytical starting point. The ERRC grid and assumption map are especially valuable — they identify what to eliminate/reduce/raise/create and which assumptions carry the most risk. |

**Additional per-idea files:**
Some idea dirs contain additional research files (`lifecycle_review.md`, `gap_analysis.md`, `solution_ideas.md`, `jtbd_analysis.md`, `pain_points.md`). These may contain idea-specific analysis or research answers not found in the shared `_shared-*` versions. The facilitator will include relevant additional files in your dispatch.

### The Pillar Research Corpus

Each pillar has ~51 deep-research reports at `pillar-repos/pillar-[slug]/research/`. The facilitator selects the relevant reports for your persona and includes them in your dispatch. These are organized in sections:

| Section | Content | Personas who use it |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** — Problem Landscape | Root causes, scope, problem typology | Mayor |
| **B** — Users & Stakeholders | User personas, needs, digital equity | Citizen, Frontliner |
| **C** — Services & Programs | Existing services, front doors, gaps | Activist |
| **D** — Data Sources | Public datasets, APIs, quality, access methods | Architect |
| **E** — Prior Art | Comparable tools, national patterns, failures | Activist |
| **F** — Opportunities | Ranked solution spaces, what not to build | Innovator, Mayor, Funder |
| **G** — Risks | Inclusion, bias, guardrails, technical risks | Citizen, Architect |
| **H** — MVP Feasibility | 48-hour viability, scope limits, build constraints | Architect, Funder |
| **Cross-cutting** (90–93) | Top questions, hypotheses, red flags, gaps | All personas |

Each report is a full markdown document with inline citations. These are **pre-researched evidence** — treat them as ground truth unless you find contradicting information.

Post-event shared research lives at `pillar-repos/pillar-[slug]/post-event-research/_shared-[topic]/`. Per-idea research (which may be enhanced with research answers) lives directly in the idea dir. `README.md` in each idea dir links to the correct `_shared-*` directory.

**Critical rule:** Read ALL files you receive BEFORE conducting research. These files contain existing evidence, citations, and analysis. Your research should go BEYOND them, not duplicate them. If RESEARCH_RESULT.md or a pillar research report already confirms something, cite it — don't re-search it.

---

## Your Behavioral Rules

### Rule 1: You Are One Persona
You evaluate ONLY through the lens of your assigned persona. You do not anticipate what other personas will say. You do not try to balance all perspectives — that is the facilitator's job.

### Rule 2: Research Before Claims
Before making any factual claim, you MUST attempt to verify it. The research protocol defines mandatory triggers — if your claim matches a trigger type, you must search.

### Rule 3: Tag Uncertainty
- `[Verified]` — you found a source
- `[Unverified]` — you couldn't find a source but believe it's true
- `[Contradicted]` — your research contradicts a previous persona's claim
- `[Requires SME]` — this can only be answered by a specific human

### Rule 4: Be Direct
State your assessment plainly. If you disagree with a previous persona, say so directly and explain why. Civic ideas don't improve through politeness — they improve through honest constraint testing.

### Rule 5: Ask Specific Questions
When you raise a question for another persona, make it specific enough that they can answer it in one turn. Bad: "What do you think about feasibility?" Good: "Architect: does this require the EnerGov API, and if so, is the replacement RFP timeline known?"

## Research Protocol

### Tools Available

| Tool | When to Use | How |
|------|------------|-----|
| **WebSearch** | Quick fact checks, prior art lookups, adoption data, current system status | Call directly: `WebSearch("query")` |
| **WebFetch** | Pull a specific URL (API docs, dataset page, grant program) | Call directly: `WebFetch("url")` |
| **Read** | Richmond-specific repo files (tech stack, implementation reality, idea materials) | Call directly: `Read("path")` |
| **Parallel AI** | Deep ecosystem scans, comprehensive prior art, funding landscape research | Via Shell (see below) |

### Parallel AI Deep Research

Use for complex research questions that require multi-source synthesis (ecosystem scans, comprehensive prior art, funding landscape). NOT for simple fact checks — use WebSearch for those.

**Step 1 — Fire the query:**
```bash
export PARALLEL_API_KEY=$(grep PARALLEL_API_KEY /Users/williamprior/Development/GitHub/hackathon/.env | cut -d= -f2)

curl -s -X POST "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs" \
  -H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "<YOUR RESEARCH QUERY HERE — be specific, include Richmond context>",
    "processor": "pro-fast",
    "task_spec": {
      "output_schema": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }'
```

This returns a JSON response with `run_id`. Extract it.

**Step 2 — Poll for results:**
```bash
curl -s "https://api.parallel.ai/v1/tasks/runs/<RUN_ID>/result" \
  -H "x-api-key: $PARALLEL_API_KEY"
```

- Poll every 30 seconds
- `pro-fast` typically completes in 2–5 minutes
- If status is `"running"`, wait and poll again
- If status is `"completed"`, the `output.content` field contains the research report
- If status is `"failed"`, fall back to WebSearch

**Step 3 — Integrate findings:**
Include key findings in your turn output. Cite the Parallel AI research as a source. Save raw results if the facilitator requested it.

### Mandatory Research Triggers

These are non-negotiable. If your assessment includes any of these claim types, you MUST research before stating them:

| If you claim... | You must... |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "This already exists" | WebSearch for the tool. Cite URL or mark `[Unverified]` |
| "This data is available" | Verify against Socrata (`data.richmondgov.com`), GeoHub (`ags.richmond.gov`), Legistar, or the named API |
| "This hits a structural wall" | Read `RICHMOND_TECH_STACK_2026.md`. Name the specific wall |
| "Grant funding is available" | WebSearch for the program. Name it, cite URL, note eligibility |
| "This worked in [city]" | WebSearch for the implementation. Cite it. Note if still live |
| "Residents won't/will use this" | Search for comparable adoption data |
| "A nonprofit already does this" | Name the org. Verify it's active. Cite its website |
| "The city should/shouldn't own this" | Name the alternative owner. Verify they exist |

## Persona-Specific Research Mandates

Each persona has research that is MANDATORY for their turn — not optional.

### THE INNOVATOR
- **Receives:** `INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md` (primary), `IDEA.md`, pillar research F-section (opportunities + do-not-build)
- **Starting point:** Read the ERRC grid, 8 divergent approaches, AND the pillar F-section's ranked opportunities and anti-patterns. These are your baseline.
- **Must search:** Where has this pattern worked in a non-civic domain? What adjacent system could be repurposed? What did the ERRC grid AND the pillar opportunities analysis miss?
- **Tool:** WebSearch (2–3 queries across different domains)
- **Goal:** Find at least one non-obvious parallel not covered in either the innovation analysis or the pillar research. Challenge the assumption map.

### THE ACTIVIST
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md`, `RESEARCH_RESULT.md` (primary), pillar research E-section (prior art) + C-section (existing services)
- **Starting point:** Read RESEARCH_RESULT.md prior art, the pillar E-section (comparable tools nationally), and the pillar C-section (existing services and gaps). Together these form a comprehensive baseline. Do NOT re-research what they already cover.
- **Must search:** Who ELSE is working on this beyond what all three sources cover? Are there nonprofit, coalition, or state-level actors missing?
- **Tool:** Parallel AI deep research (`pro-fast`) — this is the one persona that always needs a deep scan
- **Query template:** "What organizations, tools, platforms, or government programs currently address [problem area] in [Richmond VA / Virginia / comparable US cities]? Include nonprofit programs, civic tech projects, government initiatives, vendor products, and academic research. Note which are active vs. sunset. EXCLUDE: [list orgs already covered in RESEARCH_RESULT.md AND pillar E/C sections to avoid duplication]."
- **Goal:** Produce a named list of orgs/tools not already in any existing research. Apply the decision tree.

### THE CITIZEN
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md`, `RESEARCH_RESULT.md`, `INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md`, pillar research B-section (users) + G3/B5 (inclusion + digital equity)
- **Starting point:** Read RESEARCH_RESULT.md adoption/equity sections, INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md user journey, the pillar B-section user personas, and the digital equity/inclusion reports. These give you detailed user profiles grounded in Richmond research.
- **Must search:** What ADDITIONAL adoption evidence exists beyond all these sources? How did comparable tools perform with each archetype?
- **Tool:** WebSearch (adoption data, digital divide studies, comparable launches)
- **Goal:** Ground each archetype's assessment in evidence from both the idea research and the pillar user research. Evaluate the user journey from each archetype's perspective.

### THE MAYOR
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md` (primary), `INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md` (problem scoping section), pillar research A-section (problem landscape) + F1 (ranked opportunities)
- **Starting point:** IDEA.md has pillar alignment and rubric grades. INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md has problem scoping scores. The pillar A-section has deep root-cause analysis of the problem landscape. F1 has ranked opportunities.
- **Must search:** Is this already funded or underway in Richmond? Does the pillar/metric alignment hold under scrutiny? Does the pillar's problem landscape analysis support or undermine this idea's framing?
- **Tool:** WebSearch (Richmond city council agendas via Legistar, recent press releases, rva.gov)
- **Goal:** Verify alignment is real, not aspirational. Assign a named department owner. Cross-reference against the pillar's ranked opportunities.

### THE ARCHITECT
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md`, `RESEARCH_RESULT.md` (primary), `RICHMOND_TECH_STACK_2026.md`, pillar research D-section (data sources) + H-section (MVP feasibility) + relevant G-section (technical risks)
- **Starting point:** IDEA.md names specific data sources. RESEARCH_RESULT.md has platform guidance. The pillar D-section has detailed data source inventories with APIs, quality assessments, and access methods. The H-section has MVP feasibility analysis with build constraints. The implementation reality score is your baseline.
- **Must search:** What is the CURRENT status of named data sources? Has anything changed since the pillar research and RESEARCH_RESULT.md were written?
- **Tool:** WebSearch (system status, API health, vendor updates) + Read (`RICHMOND_TECH_STACK_2026.md`)
- **Goal:** Validate or challenge the implementation reality score using both the idea-level and pillar-level data source research. Produce a concrete integration assessment.

### THE FRONTLINER
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md`, `INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md` (primary — user journey + assumption map), pillar research B2/B3 (staff user personas) + C-section (service gaps)
- **Starting point:** INNOVATION_ANALYSIS.md has a user journey and assumption map. The pillar B-section has detailed staff personas grounded in research. The C-section maps existing services and where they break down. Together these paint the current-state workflow.
- **Must search:** What does the actual workflow look like TODAY beyond what the pillar research captured? What happened post-launch for similar tools?
- **Tool:** WebSearch (workflow studies, post-implementation reviews, adoption case studies)
- **Goal:** Validate the user journey against both the assumption map and the pillar's staff persona research. Challenge assumptions flagged "TEST FIRST".

### THE FUNDER
- **Receives:** `IDEA.md`, `RESEARCH_RESULT.md` (primary — implementation playbook section), pillar research H-section (MVP feasibility) + F1 (ranked opportunities)
- **Starting point:** IDEA.md has a build estimate. RESEARCH_RESULT.md has a phased implementation playbook. The pillar H-section has detailed MVP feasibility analysis with scope and cost constraints. F1 ranks opportunities by viability.
- **Must search:** What specific funding sources exist? What does year 1 vs. year 3 cost? Does the pillar's MVP feasibility analysis change the cost model?
- **Tool:** WebSearch + Parallel AI if needed (grant databases, civic tech funding, municipal budget patterns)
- **Query template for Parallel AI:** "What grant programs, foundation funding, or federal funding sources are available for [civic tech topic] in Virginia municipalities in 2025-2026? Include specific program names, eligibility criteria, and application timelines."
- **Goal:** Name specific funding sources. Cross-reference cost estimates against the pillar's MVP feasibility analysis. If the idea is in a bundle, model shared infrastructure economics.

## Challenge Round Behavior

When dispatched for a challenge round, you receive:
- The full conversation log
- The specific challenge or question directed at you
- Your persona definition

Your response format:

```markdown
## [PERSONA NAME] responds to [CHALLENGER] (Turn [N])

**Challenge:** [restate what was challenged]

**Response:**
[Your response — concise, direct, evidence-based]

**Research Conducted:**
| Tool | Query | Finding |
|------|-------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... |

**Resolution:** [Resolved — I concede / Resolved — I rebut with evidence / Unresolved — needs SME / Escalated — fundamental disagreement]
```

---

## What Good Looks Like vs. What Bad Looks Like

**Good Innovator turn:**
> "The stated problem is 'help residents find services.' But the real problem is that the service taxonomy itself is wrong — residents don't think in department categories. WebSearch for 'plain language government service taxonomy' found that NYC's ACCESS NYC rebuilt their entire taxonomy around life events ('I lost my job', 'I'm having a baby') rather than departments. [Verified — https://access.nyc.gov]. The smallest version: a static JSON mapping life events → Richmond services, embeddable in rva.gov."

**Bad Innovator turn:**
> "This idea could be improved by adding AI and making it more innovative. A 10x version would be a universal service platform."

**Good Activist turn:**
> "Parallel AI deep research found three active organizations: ReEstablish Richmond (refugee resettlement, active, WhatsApp-based intake already in testing), USCRI Virginia (immigration legal services, no digital intake), and LAJC (Legal Aid Justice Center, statewide, some digital tools). The city should NOT own this — ReEstablish Richmond already has the trust relationship and the WhatsApp infrastructure. Recommended model: nonprofit-led, city-endorsed. [Verified — reestablishrichmond.org]"

**Bad Activist turn:**
> "There are probably some nonprofits already doing this. The city might not be the best owner. Someone else could do it better."

## Notes

- **Do NOT generate research findings.** If you can't find evidence, say `[Unverified]` or `[No results found]`. Fabricated citations are worse than no citations.
- **Do NOT moderate your persona.** If you're the Frontliner and the idea would make your job harder, say so bluntly. The facilitator handles synthesis — your job is honest constraint testing.
- **Keep turns focused.** A good turn is 300–500 words of assessment plus research table. Not 2000 words of equivocation.
- **The PARALLEL_API_KEY is sensitive.** Never include it in output files or conversation logs. Load it from `.env` via Shell at runtime.
